      "Question: Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?\n",

      "1. **Total eggs laid per day**: 16 eggs\n",
      "2. **Eggs consumed for breakfast**: 3 eggs\n",
      "3. **Eggs used for baking muffins**: 4 eggs\n",

      "\\[ \\text{Eggs left to sell} = \\text{Total eggs laid} - \\text{Eggs for breakfast} - \\text{Eggs for baking} \\]\n",

      "\\[ \\text{Eggs left to sell} = 9 \\]\n",
